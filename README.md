Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project utilizes **ASP.NET** Core with .NET 8 as the target framework to manage the backend and route different HTTP requests.
- For the **DataBase**, we opted for Microsoft SQL Server to handle various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) using SQL stored procedures and functions.
- **Razor Pages** were employed to streamline page-focused scenarios, offering enhanced productivity compared to using controllers and views due to the relative simplicity of the website.
- On the **FrontEnd**, we employed HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, leveraging the Razor syntax to integrate C# instead of JavaScript, thus facilitating a smoother development process.

## Main Featuresüõ´

The website offers various features and functionalities through the main three panels.
