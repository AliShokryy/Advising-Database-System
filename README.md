Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the website uses:

- This project utilizes **ASP.NET** Core with .NET 8 as the target framework to manage the backend and route different HTTP requests.
- .NET Core was chosen over .NET Framework because it's designed to be **cross-platform**, running on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, it offers significant **performance improvements**.
- For the **DataBase**, we opted for Microsoft SQL Server to handle various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) using SQL stored procedures and functions.
- **Razor Pages** were employed to streamline page-focused scenarios, offering enhanced productivity compared to using controllers and views due to the relative simplicity of the website.
- On the **FrontEnd**, we employed HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, leveraging the Razor syntax to integrate C# instead of JavaScript, thus facilitating a smoother development process.

## Main Featuresüõ´

The website offers various features and functionalities through the main three panels.

### Admin Panel

To access the admin panel, click on **Admin** in the bottom left corner, then log in with **ID = 1** and **Password = admin**, both of which are hardcoded.

## Try it on your Machineüî®

The easiest and most straightforward way to run the fully functional website locally, avoiding weird and random bugs, is to run it through **Visual Studio**.

1. Install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and make sure to include **ASP\.NET and web development** and **Data storage and processing** workloads.

2. Clone the repository on your local machine by running the following Git command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AliShokryy/Advising-Database-System
    ```

3. Navigate to the repository root folder, then open the solution file with Visual Studio by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cd Advising-Database-System; start Team6_Advising.sln
    ```

4. Finally, create the database and run the website locally by following these simple steps:
   - Connect to MSSQLLocalDB, then execute the SQL queries in **DB_Schema.sql** to create an instance of the Advising_System database with all the needed tables, procedures, and functions.
   - Run the web server by pressing **F5**.
   - Go to [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050).
